        <h1>You Pay For It </h1>
        <P class="main-text">
            New York City is paying just about $500 Thousand a day to keep Trump Tower secure while the first lady and first child remain in New York. NYC realtors started to list the presence of the United States Secret Service as an amenity to lure potential buyers
            and renters to Trump Tower. This means a select few, those able to afford to rent/buy units in Trump Tower, are benefitting from this added security/amenity that most other tax payers who contribute to it do not have access to.
        </P>

            This is an ongoing issue for as long as the Trump family remains in New York City. Tax payers continue to foot the bill for the remainder of the time the first family stays in New York and not in Washington DC, where they belong.
